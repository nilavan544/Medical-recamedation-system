      <hr class="my-4">

      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Many people experience symptoms and search for answers — but with overlapping symptoms, it’s difficult to know what’s actually wrong. We aimed to solve this by creating a smart, AI-driven system that can guide users toward possible diagnoses based on what they feel.</p>

      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p>We built a simple, responsive web app powered by <strong>Flask</strong> and a <strong>Decision Tree Classifier</strong>. Here's what it does:</p>

      <ol class="ps-3">
        <li><strong>Symptom Input:</strong> Users enter their symptoms via an easy-to-use form interface.</li>
        <li><strong>ML Prediction:</strong> The app uses a trained Decision Tree model to analyze symptoms and predict likely diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Results:</strong> The user gets an instant prediction with additional resources about the disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Info:</strong> Includes description, precautions, medications, diet, and workouts.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Key Features</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Clean UI:</strong> Built with Bootstrap, the interface is clean and mobile-friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>Fast Predictions:</strong> Powered by ML, results come in seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive Details:</strong> Diseases come with full educational material.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge Base:</strong> The platform includes health blogs and articles to boost user awareness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>MyHealthMate</strong> bridges the gap between technology and healthcare. With the help of AI, this platform empowers users to better understand their health. It’s not a replacement for doctors, but a smart first step toward awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an age of remote healthcare, this app stands as a powerful example of how machine learning and accessible design can help people everywhere. We believe it’s a small step toward a healthier world.
      </p>
